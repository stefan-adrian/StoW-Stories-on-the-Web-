<name> Team Alpha Male product was medically suspended for 180 days, but the injuries suffered during the fight — specifically the last two strikes — were far more severe than anticipated. The hospital in Orlando originally diagnosed him with “just” a tripod fracture after the bout, but according to Emmett, they missed several more serious injuries.\n\n

“I went home and I think it was the second day that I was home in Sacramento — I was still on all the pain pills and stuff — and my wife just knew there was something wrong,” Emmett said during the MMA Hour.

The featherweight got another CT scan from a hospital in Sacramento, and the results weren’t good.

“I needed emergency surgery. They took me in an ambulance to perform another surgery,” he said. “My lateral orbital was fractured, my orbital wall, my maxillary sinus — that’s like my cheek — it was completely encaved. I had my nasal bone fractured and my zygomatic arch was broken as well, with a few other fractures in the face. It was impinging the main muscle in my eye, which was disturbing the movement of my eye. Also, the nerve in my face was being compressed.

“So still even now from the left side [of my face] over, it’s still completely numb. I have no feeling in my cheek or upper lip and I had just suffered a severe concussion.”</name>
